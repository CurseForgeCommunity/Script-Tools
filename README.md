Utility scripts that can be used as helper tools for various purposes

- **mcreator-finder.bat** - Searches through found JAR files for folders and files known to indicate the JAR being made using the mcreator tool.  Run it from th main profile folder.  ([mcreator-finder.bat Download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CurseForgeCommunity/Script-Tools/raw/main/files/mcreator-finder.bat))

- **modIDlist.bat** - Run while placed in the main directory of a profile or server.  Generates a formatted list of modIDs and their corresponding filenames.  Currently only works for Forge/Neoforge mods of MC 1.13 and newer.  ([modIDlist.bat Download link](https://github.com/CurseForgeCommunity/Script-Tools/raw/main/files/modIDlist.bat))

- **mod_searcher.bat** - Run while placed in the main directory of a profile or server.  Searches for user-entered string names inside of mod files.  Good for finding problematic mods when it isn't clear where a problem is coming from.
